what is boiler plate code?

   kind of code which we will use repeatedly
   ex: getter and setter method
   
   What is model and view?
   
   Which has to be handled carefully
   
   unchecked exception
   
   checked exception--- it is handled by the compiler
   
   if we are using runtime exception ie
   
   unchecked exception then it has to be 
   
   handled by us.
